# Email-Spam-Filter
This code is for email classification, distinguishing between “ham” (legitimate) and “spam” (unsolicited) emails. It loads data from directories, preprocesses it by removing noise and stopwords, and splits it into training and test datasets. You can enhance it with machine learning models for better predictions.
